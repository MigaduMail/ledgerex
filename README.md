A parser for [Ledger](https://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html) accounting files written in Elixir.

*Caveat Emptor*: It doesn't support the full range of ledger's capabilities.
It's just the bare minimum I needed to parse my ~10 years worth of ledger files.

Pull requests more than welcome. Be nice.
